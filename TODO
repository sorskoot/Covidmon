Must have:
     ☐ spawn random virusses
        ~ genome mutates a little
        ~ fixed number of mutationPoints
        ~ that determines the amount of damage, 
           resistance to medicine or health
        ~ variant names like English, South-African and Brazilian
     ☐ attach virussus
        ☐ T-Cells - balls we throw at the virus.
